<h1>Militarism</h1>

<img class="diagram" alt="Militarism" src="images\militarism.jpeg">
<p class="paragraph">Militarism is a belief or system where the military is exalted and it's needs and considerations are given excessive priority.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Militarism was a significent cause of World War One because it helped give people a sense that their military was well equiped and trained. This helped give countries false confidnece as other countries had a bigger budget or themselves focused on militarism. A specific example of this is the British/German navel race where Germany greatly inceased their naval size likely causing Britan to feel threatened and more inclinded to declare war.</p>
