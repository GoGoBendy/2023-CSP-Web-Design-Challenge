<img class="diagram" alt="Alliances and Treaties" src="images\wwi_causes9108035099865393103.png">
<p class="paragraph">There were two main alliances which were the triple entente and the triple allience. The triple entente was between Britan, France and Russia. The triple allience was between Germany, Austra-Hungry and Italy.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Alliances were the only reason that the Austra-Hungry, Serbia conflict was the spark that started WW1. This is because there were agreements inplace to help defend other countries or help them attack others. This is the reason that Germany, Russia and France entered the war as they had made agreements with each other tol help defend/attack others.</p>
